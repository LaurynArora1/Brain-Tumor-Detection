# Brain-Tumor-Detection
The Human brain is the most important and complex part of the body, it consists
of 50-100 billion neurons . Brain is made up of a huge number of cells, and each
cel l has its own job. Several of the bod y s cells are split to make new cells so that
the body can work well. The death of aged or damaged cells led to formation of
new cells, sometimes these new cells are produced more than the requirement of
the body, those extra cells are called tumor. Tumor can occur in many parts but
the most dangerous one is in the brain. Detection of brain tumor is a hard task and
it is very im portant to identify tumor as soon as possible. Many techniques are
used to detect the tumor, t he most common one is studying the image through
MRI but it is a time consuming technique, major time is consumed in
segmentation of the MRI image, so automatic segmentation methods should be
implem ented. In this paper we use algorithms like InceptionV3, R esNet 50 and
VGG16, which will help in auto segmentation and help in detecting brain tumor
as soon as possible.
